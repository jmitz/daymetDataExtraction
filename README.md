# Daymet Data Download
### Purpose
Script to download [Daymet](https://daymet.ornl.gov/) climatalogical data. 

### Requrements
The scripts have been written to run under Python 3.6.0. In particular I installed [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview) and documented the use of the script with Jupyter Notebook.

### Starting the Jupyter Notebook
- Clone the repository.
- Ensure that jupyter has been installed (Anaconda automatically installs jupyter)
- Change directory into the project directory
- Type <code>jupyter notebook</code> at the command prompt
- Web browser should open up to the jupyter page.
- Click on daymetDataDownload.ipynb
