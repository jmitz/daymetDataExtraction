# Daymet Data Download
### Purpose
Script to download [Daymet](https://daymet.ornl.gov/) climatalogical data.

Script to extract climate data for the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) from the Daymet rasters. (Actually this script will extract data for any raster mask )

This was based on work done by Mike Tercek (miketercek@yahoo.com) The file structure of the CSV files integrate with extraction and analysis tools developed for the Yellowstone Center for Resources, Yellowstone National Park.

### Requrements
The scripts have been written to run under Python 3.6.0. In particular I installed [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview) and documented the use of the script with Jupyter Notebook.

### Starting the Jupyter Notebook
- Clone the repository.
- Ensure that jupyter has been installed (Anaconda automatically installs jupyter)
- Change directory into the project directory
- Type <code>jupyter notebook</code> at the command prompt
- Web browser should open up to the jupyter page.
- Click on daymetDataDownload.ipynb
